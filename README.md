# tm2tb
TM2TB.com is an automatic terminology extraction Python web app, built upon Flask, Gensim, Pandas and Microsoft Azure's cognitive services. 

As a translator, we know that, in practice, there is little time to create a TB after a translation is done.

But TM2TB will help you to do that. Just load your bilingual file, and the app will analyze it and extract a nice bilingual glossary with your own translations, which you can conveniently use for future assignments.

File formats supported:
- Bilingual .tmx files
- Bilingual .csv (in two columns for source and target)
- .xlsx (Excel file in two columns for source and target)
