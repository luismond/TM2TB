TM2TB is an intelligent web app that will help translators, terminologists and linguists discover the hidden term translations in their own bilingual files.

In the video example below, you can see how the app finds translations of single terms, for example "purposes"  > "efectos", but also of compound nouns, for example "parent company" > "sociedad matriz". 

Also note that, if you translated these terms with machine translation or if you looked them up in a traditional dictionary, you would probably get literal results. 

TM2TB is different. It takes into account the context and the usage within a bilingual file and generates a term base with useful, non-literal translations that reflect the most important content of the file.
